# Moodstocks SDK - Sencha Touch Demo built with PhoneGap

This repository is made of:
* `app`: the Sencha Touch app (common to iOS and Android environments)
* `ios`: the specific PhoneGap project for iOS
* `android`: the specific PhoneGap project for Android

Each of them contains a detailed README to help you get started.

Please keep in mind that:
* The iOS and Android PhoneGap projects rely on a different `cordova.js` version, even if this file has the same name. The empty `cordova-2.3.0.js` serves as a mock file.
* `build.xml` has been modified in order to copy the generated Sencha Touch app to seperate `www` folders with the correct `cordova.js` file.
